```shell script
pipenv shell                          # using pipenv
conda activate envs/mntproj_py3.12.7  # using Anaconda
```

Start using Flask:
```shell script
python app
```

Start using Gunicorn:  
Set the number of workers to (number of CPU cores x 2) + 1
```shell script
gunicorn -w 3 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 --timeout 1800 app:app
nohup gunicorn -w 3 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 --timeout 1800 app:app >/var/log/mntproj/gunicorn.log 2>&1 <&- &

```

### Run as a script

python scrape_mntproj.py thomas-anderson 60
```

Options:

The UID/name must be present in [mntproj_user_ids.yaml](mntproj_user_ids.yaml), example:
```yaml
thomas-anderson: 123456789
suzy-bishop: 000000002
```

### Setup

```shell script
cd mntproj-compare
```

Use any of the following to install dependencies.

* Install dependencies from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Creating a virtual environment beforehand is recommended.
```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Create virtual environment and install dependencies from [Pipfile.lock](Pipfile.lock):
```shell script
pipenv install
```

* Anaconda can also be used to create a virtual environment.

Create cache file if doesnâ€™t exist:
```shell script
echo '{}' > all_route_ticks.json
```
